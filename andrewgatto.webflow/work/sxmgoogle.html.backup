        <h3 class="casesectitle">Background</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="paragraph">On October 18, 2018, SiriusXM announced a new marketing agreement with Amazon.com that bundled Amazon&#x27;s popular line of Echo smart speakers with SiriusXM&#x27;s streaming service, to offer easy access to SXM&#x27;s acclaimed programming in their home.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Prospects were able to take advantage of this offer in one of two ways: <br></p>
        <ul role="list" class="bulletedlist numbered">
          <li>through Amazon.com, in which echo device owners would receive free SiriusXM for three months with purchase of a subscription, or</li>
          <li>through SiriusXM.com, in which they would receive a free Echo dot with the purchase of a subscription. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">In 2019, SiriusXM and Google teamed up for a similar agreement, but this time, the goal was to get the Google Home Mini smart speakers in the hands of new SiriusXM subscribers and to get SiriusXM to existing Google Home device owners.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">As this was our first venture into the Google Home ecosystem, it was important to make a good first impression. I was tasked with creating an out-of-the-box experience for users so that they could begin listening to SiriusXM ¬†on their Google Home as easily as possible. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="casesectitle"><strong>Scoping the project</strong></h3>
        <div class="paragraph-small">February 2019</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="paragraph">The Amazon partnership would teach us a lot about how customer&#x27;s felt about <em>that</em> out-of-box experience. So when it became time to design Google&#x27;s, the process started by learning the user flow we deployed with Amazon and try to identify where in the flow was causing frustration or delight among our users. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">After speaking with our customer service representatives and reading the angry user reviews on our skill&#x27;s page (there were a few üòÖ) we learned the sources of user frustration-- linking the skill was too burdensome.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">With the old flowchart mapped out and the user frustrations understood, the next step was understanding the goals of the Google Partnership:</p>
        <ul role="list" class="bulletedlist">
          <li>What was the end-to-end marketing flow that the user would experience?</li>
          <li>What were SiriusXM&#x27;s business goals?</li>
          <li>What restrictions from Google did we have to be mindful of?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">To learn the end-to-end user flows for the offers on <a href="http://siriusxm.com" class="textlink_inline">siriusxm.com</a> and on <a href="http://store.google.com" class="textlink_inline">store.google.com</a>, I¬†worked with the Marketing team, the CX¬†team responsible SiriusXM.com,¬†and the development team responsible for account authentication. Once we had clear and accurate documentation of these flows we started analyzing ways to make each experience more efficient.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="casesectitle"><strong>Collecting information</strong></h3>
        <div class="paragraph-small">February 2019</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="paragraph">From the cross-team discussions, we learned that users registering for the offer on siriusxm.com would be issued a unique discount code once they had created SiriusXM¬†login credentials and completed their purchase. The unique discount code worked to adjust the price of a Google Home Mini at check out at Google&#x27;s online Store.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Analyzing the checkout flow on Google&#x27;s store, revealed that signing in to a Google account prior to purchase was Google&#x27;s preferred method for checkout.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">After thinking more about the Google Home hardware, we realized that smart speakers are only smart in name ‚Äî everything about it&#x27;s settings and configurations was controlled using the Google Home app.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This was our big breakthrough.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="casesectitle"><strong>Architecting the solution</strong></h3>
        <div class="paragraph-small">March 2019</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="paragraph">With the goal of making the account linking task as frictionless as possible, we ideated on the idea of a fully back-end solution.<br></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Since the user was provided a unique redemption code that was tied to their SiriusXM credentials when they purchased their subscription and since the user was signed into their Google Account when they redeemed that code for their free Google Home Mini ‚Äî we had a technical connection between the user&#x27;s two accounts.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Users receiving their Google Home Mini would set up the hardware as they normally would: download the Google Home App and sign in to their Google Account.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Once the user was signed in, their SiriusXM account would already be linked and activated on the software side. This solution eliminated the user requirement of performing any tasks related to SiriusXM account linking and solved the challenges of user-gifted devices or the logistical burden of sending a specific hardware unit.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Out-of-the-box, we figured out, the best experience was one that wasn&#x27;t.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="casesectitle">Next Steps</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="paragraph">The Google Partnership is anticipated for a Q4 2019 release. Beyond the experience detailed above, various fallback states exists to catch users who stray from the happy path. Due to contractual obligations, the documentation of that artifact may be available upon request.</p>
