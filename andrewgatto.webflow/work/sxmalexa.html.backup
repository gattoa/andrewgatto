          <p class="paragraph">SiriusXM is the world&#x27;s largest audio entertainment company and reaches more than 100 million people with its audio products. On Amazon’s Alexa-enabled devices, users had access 200+ broadcast channels and 100+ Xtra Channels — but couldn’t access our 7,000 On-Demand episodes due to the limitations of Amazon’s Music Skill Kit, which couldn’t meet the needs of SiriusXM’s unique content catalogue.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Amazon was in the early-stages of developing Alexa’s Podcast Skill Kit, so we teamed up with their Spoken Word product team to develop a solution that could accommodate the complex needs of SiriusXM’s On-Demand content, and that Amazon could gracefully degrade for other general Podcasting Skills. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">We collaborated on user research, product design, and ultimately — implementation. I acted as the lead product designer from the SiriusXM side.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">The practice of UX starts with Planning and Discovery — and here, it was no different. During our kick-off meeting in Seattle, we set our focus on planning the engagement. Our UX Questionnaire helped us answer crucial logistical questions about the team, our goals, our users, the primary tasks &amp; scenarios our product should support, key dates &amp; milestones, significant upfront risks and success measures. </p>

          <h3 class="casesectitle">Creating our UX Plan</h3>
          <div class="paragraph-small">November 2018</div>
        </div>
        <div class="column_casestudy w-col w-col-9">
          <p class="paragraph">After the product team was satisfied with the administrative planning, I collaborated with a UX researcher at Amazon to solidify our UX plan. We worked together to scope this assignment and determine which practices to employ in order to design a great user experience.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Our research goals aimed to ensure that we understood: </p>
          <ol role="list" class="bulletedlist">
            <li>What customers say to Alexa, and </li>
            <li>The experience they expect to have when interacting with her. </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="paragraph">We ideated around various scenarios to try to reasonably identify a user’s mindset <strong><em>before</em></strong>, <strong><em>during</em></strong>, and <strong><em>after</em></strong> interacting with the skill — and ultimately led us to create a list of common tasks that a user would likely perform using this skill. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Some of these tasks included:</p>
          <ul role="list" class="bulletedlist">
            <li>Ask to play a channel</li>
            <li>Ask to play a show</li>
            <li>Ask to fast-forward through a show</li>
            <li>Ask to play another episode from last week</li>
            <li>Ask to play an episode with a particular guest</li>
            <li>Ask to play a particular segment of a show</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="paragraph">Having a user perform these tasks helped us identify and capture utterances, but did not capture the user’s expectation of how the conversation would continue — or even if it needed to.<br></p>
          <p class="paragraph">In oder to understand the user’s expectations of how the system would respond, we expanded our task-based list to include various situations that could form an alternative expectation for the user.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Our list grew to look like this:</p>
          <ul role="list" class="bulletedlist">
            <li>Ask to play a show. What happens if: </li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">the show is currently on air? </li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">the show is currently on air and halfway through? </li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">the show is not on air?</li>
            <li>Ask to fast forward through a show. What happens if:</li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">they only have a limited number of skips within a show?</li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">they are unable to skip within a show?</li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">they want to get to another segment in a show?</li>
            <li>Ask to play another episode from last week. What happens if:</li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">the show is no longer available?</li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">multiple episodes are found?</li>
            <li>Ask to play an episode with a particular guest. What happens if: </li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">the show is no longer available?</li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">multiple episodes are found?</li>
            <li class="bulletindent_1">the show is not specified and the guest is found on multiple shows?</li>
            <li>Ask to play a particular segment of a show</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="paragraph">Once our objectives became clear, we felt that interviewing users would be an effective research strategy and started planning on participant recruiting for user interviews.</p>

        <div class="column_casestudy w-col w-col-9">
          <p class="paragraph">Our goal was to recruit 6 SiriusXM customers who listened to a range of SiriusXM channels and shows, both live and on-demand. We also wanted a mix of participants that had used voice assistants versus those who hadn’t. We circulated a screener survey and identified 10 participants that were candidates for our user interviews.</p>

          <div class="paragraph-small">December 2018</div>
        </div>
        <div class="column_casestudy w-col w-col-9">
          <p class="paragraph">Interviews were conducted with eight participants (two participants cancelled on us) over two days in Seattle. Each session lasted about 30 minutes and helped us collect natural spoken utterances and gain insights on user behaviors in the context of SiriusXM. Users were given tasks, and their responses were recorded to help make sure we completely and accurately captured their utterances and their thoughts about the CX that they expected for the SiriusXM and Amazon Podcast Skill Kit features.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Following the sessions, we conducted a debrief to identify some of the trends we noticed among the participants. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Overall the biggest challenge was user awareness of the SiriusXM on-demand catalog. In the mind of most participants, SiriusXM was viewed as a live radio service and participants did not naturally think to ask for on-demand content, and those who did had difficulty asking for it. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Participants typically asked to play content by channel number or channel name. When tasked with discovering content by topic or guest, the participants consistently omitted clarifying information in their utterances (i.e. Show name, channel name, ‘on SiriusXM’ etc.).<br><br>Given the generality of their utterances, most participants expected a multi-turn CX to disambiguate the potential results found. Although this was commonly expected, the Amazon and SiriusXM teams agreed that this could create friction and, in reality, prove to be very frustrating. Amazon’s team conducted a follow up study to detect the right balance of disambiguation and friction, although the results of that study fall outside the scope of this case study. </p>

          <p class="paragraph">Following the study,<strong> </strong>we presented our findings to SiriusXM’s Alexa product team and the Alexa Spoken Word Team. We continued to work together over the next three weeks to align on the Voice UI, which ultimately allowed users to request:</p>
          <ul role="list" class="bulletedlist">
            <li>On-demand shows, </li>
            <li>An episode by a specific topic</li>

            <li>The most recent episode of a particular show</li>
            <li>Previous and/or next episodes of a show, once a user began playback of an on-demand episode</li>
            <li>To Navigate by specific time increments (known as Variable Seek)</li>
            <li>To restart an episode</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="paragraph">We also included the ability for users to request a recommendation for a show. The CX for playing live stations was unchanged.</p>
